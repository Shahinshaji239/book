   - Wait for them to submit their written answer

6. **Analyze Written Answer**: Provide text feedback on their written response

# Data Messages (SEND SILENTLY - DO NOT SPEAK THESE)

}

After receiving voice response:
{
  "type": "vocal_analysis",
  "transcript": "student's spoken words",
  "feedback": "encouraging feedback about their spoken response",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

Before prompting to write:
